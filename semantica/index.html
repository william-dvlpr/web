            <h3>Star Shopping</h3>
    
            <p>Wait right here <br>
            I'll be back in the mornin' <br>
            I know that I'm not that important to you <br>
            But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah) <br>
            So much more than perfect (Yeah) <br>
            Right now I know that I'm not really worth it <br>
            If you give me time, I could work on it <br>
            Give me some time while I work on it <br>
    
            <em>
                Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you <br>
                The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah) <br>
                Look at my face when I fuck on your waist <br>
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week
            </em> <br>
    
            That's why your friends always hatin' on me <br>
            Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself <br>
            Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help <br>
            And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings <br>
            None of my exes is over Lil Peep <br>
            Nobody flexin' as much as I be <br>
            That's why she text me and tell me she love me <br>
            She know that someday I'll be over the sea <br>
            Makin' my money and smokin' my weed <br>
            I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me <br>
            
            <em>
                Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me <br>
                I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be <br>
                If I find a way, would you walk it with me? <br>
                Look at my face while you talkin' to me <br>
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week <br>
                Can I get one conversation at least? <br>
                Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach<br>
                <strong>This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces</strong>
            </em><br></p>
    
            <span>[Chorus]</span>
    
            <p>Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason <br>
            A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces <br>
            <strong>Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason</strong><br></p>
